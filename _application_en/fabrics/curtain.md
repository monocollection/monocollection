The installation of curtains requires professional attention to a variety of factors depending on the client’s preferences, the specific characteristics and use of the space, privacy levels, and material properties and concepts. It is also important to consider how the view through the window  influences those who live within. In the ‘softerior’ concept of Mono Collection, we pursue the harmony between curtain, wallpaper, furniture, exterior setting, and function.
