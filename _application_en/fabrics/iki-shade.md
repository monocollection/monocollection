The Iki-Shade sunscreen is designed in practical sizes to function as additional  window or doors shade that  harmonizes with  existing curtains and door screens. It can also be used for other purposes, such as a scarf, beach towel, tablecloth, blanket, and bed throw.

The materials of the Iki-Shade sunscreen serve to both separate and connect the inside and outside of a room, combining the symbolic meaning of the image represented on the fabric and color and texture of the materials in order to attract  positive energy.
