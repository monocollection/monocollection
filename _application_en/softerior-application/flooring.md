Applications and  experimentation with a variety of materials, techniques and patterns brings innovative new designs for floor coverings. Hwamunseok, the application of a traditional technique  to modern life, was developed through collaboration with Kwangmyung Hwaumseok craftspeople in Korea, and has opened up the  possibility of sustainable and   original beauty through traditional practices. Other applications are also  under development, such as flooring in colored lacquer  and tiles.
