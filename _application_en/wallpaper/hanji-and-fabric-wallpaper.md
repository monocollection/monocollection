Our Hanji wallpaper is produced by digital printing on special paper produced in Jeonju, Korea. If you require  a deeper sense of beauty combined with robustness, using printed paper is the answer. In addition,  we can make paper backed fabric wallpaper with all Mono Collection fabrics. Our wallpapers have multiple applications, ranging from residential spaces and hotels to domestic interiors, as well as being used as artworks  in their own right and on furniture. The goal is to bring the space and the wallpaper into perfect harmony.
