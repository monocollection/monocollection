In modern life, the folding screen is an essential medium for organizing space.
Mono Collection is  inspired by this traditional Oriental method of separating space. One of its most important characteristics  is that the pictures on the screen also draw in the surrounding context, bringing a narrative dimension to the space. 

In addition to  large folding screens for space separation, Mono Collection produces table dividers of various sizes, and concertina books for presentation purposes and gifts.
