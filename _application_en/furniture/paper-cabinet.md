The paper cabinet is  one of the most important aesthetic and practical objects derived from the Joseon period.

Mono Collection has been inspired by this special Korean form for more than 20 years. In 2005, we  exhibited  paper cabinets at the Mori Art Museum, and since then have developed the genre. The paper cabinet is  a work of art for living, and can be usefully applied  to and transform modern life in the guise of the wardrobe, chest-of-drawers, bookcase, table, and light fitting.
