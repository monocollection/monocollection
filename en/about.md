**PHILOSOPHY**    

Mono Collection seeks the true pleasure that comes from harmony
between humanity and nature, the old and new.
We pursue design that fits the modern sensibility, with motifs that
are deeply embedded in our minds, and we combine pattern, form,
color, space, and architecture to create exciting new designs,
making our everyday lives more beautiful, calm, simple, and
comfortable.

**HISTORY**    

The history of Mono Collection is the history of Mono Collection fabrics, and of following in the footsteps of designer Chang Eungbok. Since its founding in 1985, under the brand ‘Mono&#39;, the company has combined Korean aesthetics with the lifestyles of modern people, and has offered pure, beautiful, and practical products and interior styling.

In 1989, the company changed its name to &quot;Mono Collection”, and in 1991 it became
“Mono Collection Co., Ltd.” In the 1990s, Chang Eungbok started to work on home-related projects, and developed furniture and textile products while mainly working on overseas hotel development. As a lifestyle designer, Chang Eungbok continuously worked to integrate the beauty of traditional Korea into modern life.

In the 2000s, Mono Collection grew into a more design-oriented company through
overseas exhibitions, large and small domestic exhibitions, promotions, and diverse
projects. Since 2010, it has been a leader in the field of pattern design development and image identity through media and collaborative projects.
