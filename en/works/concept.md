The patterns collected in MONO COLLECTION are categorized within Chang Eungbok’s design concept according to three broad themes: ‘Mountain-Water,’ ‘Peach Blossom Dream,’ and ‘Daam.’   
Together, they represent a wide variety of visual, sensual, and emotional experiences, that are linked by Chang’s abiding interest in Korean culture and her desire to create a genuinely contemporary design style.
