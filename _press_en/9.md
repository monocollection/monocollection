This project was inspired by the  'Album of eight landscapes’ (Kansong Museum of Art) by the famous Joseon period artist Gyeomjae Jeong Seon, which struck me like a breeze in the middle of summer. ‘Jaha-dong'  depicts the summer scenery of the valley of Inwang mountain, 'Cheongpungae', a house in Cheongsong-dang, the scenery of Baekak Mountain, and the Jangdong area under Inwang mountain. In these pale luminous works I discovered the inexhaustible  delights of the summer scenery in old Seoul’s‘Baeksasil’ district.
