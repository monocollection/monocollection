The word 'place' has a different  meaning than ‘space.’  For  those who occupy a place, there are  always stories and memories. A space becomes a place when  personal history is added. From the music that fills the air, the taste that awakens the taste buds, the aromas that stimulate the nose, to evocative sounds and images. The home furnishings proposed by Mono Collection  and Chang Eungbok  are in contact with this idea of  ‘place.’  Chang creates works that coexist within a living environment, not  just that occupy  space. This is a vibrant place where furnishings seem to flow smoothly and interact with the living. The authentic identity of Mono Collection can be found here.
