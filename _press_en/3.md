### The Room of Sun-Filled Plenitude

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

The bedroom is the only space that is intimately shared with others. It is very private, but also has to guarantee as much freedom as possible. It must be a place where we are recharged with new energy every day.  The bedroom is  place for intimacy and decisions, but above all, for sleep. That's why we need to create a calm, organized,  and free environment. This requires good energy.  We need a space that is untouched  by light until the sun comes up, and that then gently  caresses our eyes. Color, textures, and smells, bright energy, when all are balanced perfectly,  reach not only the body but the mind.
