### 'House,  Winter Invitation.'

* Planning: Kim Mi Jin
* Photography: Park Chan-woo

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

A lyrical house in the theme of white-on-white, a project from the 2013 collection of Mono Collection. The interior, consisting of modular furniture and modular cushions that can be re-arranged as desired, seems to sink into the idyllic scenery of early winter like a dreamy forest.
