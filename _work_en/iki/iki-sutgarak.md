The patchwork was designed to wrap or carry food, jewelry, clothing, books, etc., and played an important role in marriage and special occasions. The women of Joseon gathered cloths from the process of making clothes and futon, and put them together to make a cloth and make it useful for the living. I did not cut large fabric, but I attached the fabric that came out by chance, so I did not have any special intention or plan, but the result showed a good shape. This is called 'beauty of unplannedness' and it is also called 'Korean formative beauty' which is potentially permeated. This works well with the modern sense, so it is as good as the abstract art.

This design shows a spoon silhouette with various patterns printed within. It is  jogak-iki  patchwork in another form.
