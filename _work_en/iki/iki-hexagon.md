Evidence of patchwork can easily be found in societies both in the East and West. People must have started patchworks because they did not have the technology to fabricate huge areas of cloth. Jogakbo is one of the items created in the women’s quarters in Korea.

I created the genre, Jogak-iki after seeing the patchwork in Dong-hwa Heo’s collection in order to apply this formal beauty to household items. I made patchworks of the patterns I have designed over the past thirty years, and thereby created a new system of patterns.

It requires an eye for a beauty that encompasses the balance between horizontality and verticality, and the contrast between colors and textures. These patterns created through patchwork for bedding, curtains, and rugs, radiate a modern and Korean beauty.

This pattern reproduced the hexagonal format in a more linear style.
