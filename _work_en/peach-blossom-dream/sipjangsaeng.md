In the East, we call the ten things from nature through which we reflect our wish to live with youth and vigor for a long time, sipjangsaeng.

The sun and the moon light the world during the day and the night, and mountains and rivers are unchanging. Bamboo trees bend but do not break, and pine trees are evergreen. Turtles and cranes live for a long time, and the deer is meek and aloof. The magical mushroom is the miracle drug for eternal life that even the Chinese Emperor Chin coveted.

I gathered the mother-of-pearl plates with ten longevity symbol patterns, rearranged them, and borrowed only the silhouettes, and applied the jacquard technique to create a single tone jacquard.
