The fan is a tool for making a breeze in summer, but sometimes it was used symbolically as the baton to reveal status, or as a device to cover the face to reduce cumbersome salutations.

Fans can be made with different materials and in different shapes such as the Taegeukseon (fan with Yin-yang pattern) in a circular shape, Jwilbuchae or Jeopseon (foldable fan), and Yoonseon (wheel-shaped fan), which is unfolded into a circle. I mostly use circular fans when making fan patterns. If applied to summer curtain or wallpaper, my fan pattern creates an image that brings to mind a picture in an old magazine.
