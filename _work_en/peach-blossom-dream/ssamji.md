The women of the Gangreung region, where boudoir handicraft was very advanced, used to create rectangular and circular patterns through repeated needlework using five-color thread, or simply created apricot or laurel patterns. Especially, the pouch pattern was borrowed from the geometric needlework of the antique embroidered pouch.

My pattern was simplified and repeated in all directions to give the effect of connecting a number of pouches, like patchwork. The varying thickness of the threads effects the texture of the needlework, and occasional difference between stitches gives the work a certain uniqueness. These geometric patterns with a handmade feel are a quilt blanket, and also in embroidered needlework when applied to a cushion cover.
