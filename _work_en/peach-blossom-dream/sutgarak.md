In Korea, the spoon naturally coexists with the chopsticks on top of the table, and is used for eating the main and side dishes. A spoon is simply a circle and a straight line attached, but I added the feeling of manual work in order to express the textures and traces of time.

I used black as the basic color, and accentuated it with red here and there. This pattern design can be incorporated into a tablecloth, thereby creating a direct association, or into wallpaper to introduce the depths of time.
