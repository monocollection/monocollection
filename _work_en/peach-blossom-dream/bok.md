Goryeo Cheongja Muryang Boju Tugak Hyangro (celadon incense burner) comprises a spherical plique à jour lid, lotus shaped body, and a disc shaped platform supported by three rabbit figures. It was the round plique à jour orb called Boju that caught my eye.

Boju represents the life force that fills the universe, and while this force does not possess any fixed form, it borrows the spherical shape for visual expression. Some details were taken out, and some lines were connected, based on the minimalist concept.

The fabric was laser cut to give the sense of the plique à jour, incense burner, and stitches were applied like the pouch. I named it Bok pattern, because it means ‘lucky sign’ and ‘good fortune’.

&#x2A; Luck
