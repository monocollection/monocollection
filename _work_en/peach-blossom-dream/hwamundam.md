It is easy to find walls that show patterns of flowers, ten traditional symbols of longevity, and auspicious characters, when you walk inside the ancient palaces, such as Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung in Seoul. Inspired by these walls, I  tried to create the effect of a patterned wall, looking as though it was made by woven bamboo.
