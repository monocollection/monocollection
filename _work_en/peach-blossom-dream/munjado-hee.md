The Chinese character, Hee (å–œ, Happiness), is often found on the household items of Joseon. The symmetrical beauty of the Chinese character, and the positive implications of the character itself, are symbolic and are welcomed anywhere and anytime. I designed a pattern based on one I found on an embroidered cushion, and used the burn-out organza technique inspired by the technique used to make sari in India. I used the original patterns surrounding the character, Hee, as the central patterns of a cushion, or turned them into wallpaper designs to bring positive energy to an interior space.
