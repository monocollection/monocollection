I purchased a number of small dining tables while I was engaged in the antique business after I was drawn to the woodenware of Joseon. There was one time when I bought many small dining tables with their legs separated, the beautiful lines of the legs scattered around the floor caught my eyes while carpenters were working on them.

I took pictures of them, arranged the photos repeatedly, extracted silhouettes and created patterns. Eventually, it turned into a pattern that looks like an abstract painting, and the original design motif is not easy to recognize.
