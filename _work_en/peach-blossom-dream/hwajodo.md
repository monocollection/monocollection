Hwajodo, flower and bird painting, must be the most common of all paintings of Joseon. They were very popular themes, as anyone can easily find flowers and birds, so there were fewer limitations in drawing them. Furthermore, flowers and birds have auspicious meaning.

Koreans would transcribe the image of the plants they commonly found around them in nature such as the peony, chrysanthemum, pomegranate, apricot, lotus, camellia, and bamboo, and also expressed through unique forms by adding characteristics.

Paper-decorated furniture has white Korean paper on the outside and flower-bird painting on the inside, so that a flower garden opens out each time a door is opened. It is marvelous and beautiful.
