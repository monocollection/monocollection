A thimble was a necessity for the women of Joseon, where sewing was daily work. Women in those days brought thimbles to use for life as a part of the wedding dowry. It is a small item, but they made it both beautiful and practical because it was something they used all the time. Shapes of flowers, butterflies, or other things that represent luck were used to embroider the thimble by carefully making each stitch.

Although small, each thimble is a perfect piece of art. Placed in a row, they formed a collection. With the fabric in brilliant colors from pink to blue and yellow, and the embroidery, thimbles created much more than just a womanly mood.
