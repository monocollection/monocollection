Filled with sparkling seeds in a red pouch, the pomegranate was known as a symbol of fertility, and its pattern was embroidered on wedding costumes and ceremonial robes in order to guarantee good fortune, and particularly the births of many sons.

Design-wise, the pomegranateâ€™s brilliant red enhances the impact of the whole image. It also has interesting parts, such as small, transparent, red seeds that seem as though they will burst out from inside.

In my design, the image of a pomegranate tree was subtly drawn, and the fruit was intentionally expressed in sensual color.
