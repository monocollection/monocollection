Folk painting fully reflects the national sentiment of the Korean people.

I came across folk paintings that are like drawings while looking through the collection of Yeol-soo Yoon at Gahoe Museum in Seoul. The deer and rabbit in four paintings looked as though they were flying.

They are the most minimal and modern looking among all the folk paintings I have ever seen. I wanted to fully express through flying birds, deer, and rabbits this numinous world in order to develop patterns from these works that depict dreams and fantasies. I took the themes, overlaid patterns, and colored them partially.
