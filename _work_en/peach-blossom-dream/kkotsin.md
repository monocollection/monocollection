The artist Suk-nam Yun usually works with wood, and one of her works, showing flower shoes painted on a tree, caught my eyes instantly. Most women in the old days could not afford flower shoes. They were only a fantasy or superficially attractive, the subject of aspiration, hence the unwearable flower shoes painted on the tree.

I asked for Suk-nam Yunâ€™s permission, and started the pattern design. But it was not as easy as I thought. I could only look at the painting for two years, but then one day I simply rearranged the painting and found what I wanted.

I came across my color while separating the colors from the original, and I used it in the pattern. This flower shoe pattern was received very favorably as soon as it was released, and has enjoyed popularity consistently for over a decade.
