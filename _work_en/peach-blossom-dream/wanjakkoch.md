A hanok (traditional house) of an acquaintance in the Bukchon district  of Seoul  had been preserved for a long time in a quiet alley, and I was surprised one day to  see it under reconstruction. One side of the wallpaper in  a room was torn, and there were several layers overlapped. The wallpapers that people who  lived in the house  had left. Among them, a blurred four-ply continuous pattern of an off-white color came into sight. It was a peony pattern. It was interesting because it showed traces of the modern style. The wallpaper was painted with peonies in a row on every side, and made with cheap materials, and the texture of the paper was rough, being designed to maximize the feel and texture.
