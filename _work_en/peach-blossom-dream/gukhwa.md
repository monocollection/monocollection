There was a painting of a peony and chrysanthemum among the folding screen collections of the artist Lee Ufan who held an exhibition of his collection of Joseon’s art in Musée Guimet in Paris, France, in 2001.

I was working on the image of the chrysanthemum borrowed from a relic, and thought it would be a good idea to use the rubbing effect. I printed the image on silk using translucent lacquer to prepare the fabric.

I made curtains, sofa covers, lamp shades, and so on, and had the best result with the lamp shade. Since the fabric was prepared with translucent dye, the light filtered through the shade and spread subtly throughout the space, making an interior mood more elegant.
