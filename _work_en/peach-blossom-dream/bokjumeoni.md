Traditional Korean garments, called hanbok, do not have pockets, and people needed a pouch to carry items. Regardless of sex and age, people made pouches and carried them around their waists or in their hands, and they called them lucky pouches. The most common ones were gwijumeoni, made by folding each side, and durujumeoni with a round bottom and creases around the opening.

They were made of silk or cotton, and had Chinese characters representing long life, good fortune, wealth, or the pattern of ten symbols of longevity embroidered on them. I designed each into a pattern as though I was collecting good fortune. Durujumeoni with many flower patterns and simple gwijumeoni were overlaid on top of one another to complete a pattern.
