Korean people have worshiped mountains from ancient times, considering them auspicious. As we gave great importance to nature, and wished to live in harmony with it, there are many paintings that depict the mountains so as to keep it close to human daily life.

I wanted to create a patchwork with my patterns after seeing a patchwork made by a Spanish fashion designer.

I simply placed various natural objects such as landscapes, pomegranates and apricots in folk paintings, and bookshelf paintings alongside household items, like buildings standing side by side, and also extracted patterns implying luck, and edited them freely as if I was creating a patchwork from them.
