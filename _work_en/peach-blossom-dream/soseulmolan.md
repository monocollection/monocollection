The Soseul peony pattern was based on motifs from a Korean temple design. Soseul means a flower that is sculpted in relief.

This pattern was inspired by the flower door in Bulgapsa Temple in Yeongguan, Jeonnam Province. This pattern shape can also be used in furniture-making by applying to other materials such as aluminum and wood.
