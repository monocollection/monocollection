The Fish symbolizes fertility and abundance because it lays many eggs. Fish sleep with their eyes open, and so they are used in the Buddhist temple to remind us that we should be spiritually awake at all times in the age of chaos and confusion. After examining examples of fish painting, Eorakdo, an idea came to mind.

I placed the work Gureumbogi, which I had created with a cloud extracted from the Gwandongpalgyeong (Eight Famous Spots of in Eastern Korea) by Jeong Seon on the computer screen through digital processing, and then placed the shape of a fish I had created with leftover pieces of cloth through needlework on top. It is therefore a pattern created by combining digital and analogue techniques.
