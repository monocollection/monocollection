In East Asia, the peony is the flower of flowers, the queen of flowers. It was referred to as the flower of abundance, representing ‘wealth and honor,’ and also the flower that means the guarantee of long life. It was a common theme for folding screens, paintings, grayish-blue-powdered celadon, and blue and white porcelain in palaces and the main rooms or women’s quarters of the mansions of noble families.

I was inspired by my 1950s  embroidery collection from Korea,  and made embroidered fabrics on silk.
