Among the white porcelain of Joseon, there are large and small varieties with names such as Ipho, Wonho, and Daeho. Ipho is tall, and Wonho and Daeho are large and circular like the moon. I applied to the pattern the difference in size according to the use of the jars.

Patterns offer more intense feeling when they are created from objects of fixed sizes, such as flowers, trees, and ceramics, ones that can be easily found in everyday life, but with freely adjusted scales. Patterns created by maximizing or minimizing the outlines of objects with beautiful silhouettes such as Baekjaho are minimal but have unexpected effects.
