The potters who created inlaid celadon lost their job after Goryeo fell and Joseon emerged, and they scattered into the deep mountains and valleys, and began to create ceramics freely out of their own senses and techniques.

These are called grayish-blue-powdered celadon as they maintained the basics, coating the base material made of gray clay with white clay and revealing patterns using various techniques.

I transcribed the peony patterns, blurred them as though they are dyed in yellow, overlaid, and subtracted them to bring out the patternâ€™s effect.
