My daughter, who studied textile design too, wanted to create a pattern design on the theme of Jeong Seon’s work, and she used the discharging technique to remove all colors from the blank silk fabric to create a pattern. She incorporated the drawing and computer work on it to create a mysterious pattern as if it had been dyed naturally.

She gave me this pattern as a gift while preparing for my ‘Peach Blossom Dream’ exhibition, at the Seoul Museum of Art, and I made large and small cushions using this pattern as a waterfall.
