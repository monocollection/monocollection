I had the chance to travel from Jeongseon in Gangwon-do to Boseong in Jeolla-do with a a group of artists and curators. We chartered a tourist bus to visit the heart of the mountains in Jeongseon, and visited Songwang Temple, and had a wonderful and meaningful time.

Later, artist Suk-nam Yun made a pencil sketch called ‘Way to Jeongseon.’ I excerpted the mountain part of the work, expressed in thick lines, and turned it into a monotone pattern to bring out the texture.
