Gwandong Palgyeongdobyeong is a folding screen of 8 parts showing eight magnificent scenes in Eastern Korea at the Daegwan Ridge, and it is the work of Jeong Seon. I felt more attracted to the works of Jeong Seon while living at the foot of Bukak Mountain, which is also where he lived.
I extracted a part of the painting showing the beautiful scenery of Joseon after appreciating the painting for a while, and created a pattern naming it Gureumbogi. While Gureumbogi is already a beautiful pattern, I placed fish on top to create Gangmulgogi (River Fish), giving it a more specific shape.
