This pattern was made with the motif of a painting of Sobong, Nah  Su - Yeon, but the title was inspired by  a poem of  Kim Jung - hee, &lt;Nanmaengcheop&gt;.

The lacquer drawing of the orchid by Sobong, Nah Su-Yeon was so sophisticated that it could not easily be copied or adapted.  It was appropriate to print on cloth. The lower part was cut in a straight line with scissors, so that the sophistication of the original was shown more concisely.
