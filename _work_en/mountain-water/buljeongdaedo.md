As though he was awed by the poet Jeong Cheol’s (Songgang) ability to describe the magnificent landscape of Eastern Korea realistically, Jeong Seon painted Buljeongdaedo to suit the Gasa (a form of Korean literature). His black and white watercolor on silk shows the jagged peaks of Geumgang Mountain soaring subtly as though they are dyed in wet fog on a raining morning.

It is difficult to reproduce this subtle feeling when designing a pattern. I tried to find the material to use as a base, and various techniques to effectively present the subtle feeling. My efforts produced unpredictable outcomes, and I stopped working for a time, but I returned to the challenge again, knowing the difficulties.
