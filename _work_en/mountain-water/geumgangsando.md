The Geumgang Mountains, with a total area of ​​12,000 square meters, is divided into Namgwanggang, Yeonggumgang, and Haegumgang, each of which has a unique character. Many artists have painted them. In the late Joseon Dynasty,   the scenery became the source of many  Jingeong, or ‘true-view’,  landscape paintings.

I tried to catch the beauty of this superb view. My design expresses the linear forms  of the ridges which are carved from  the rock,  a mountain stream that  sweeps down the slope, and the thin line of a pathway.
