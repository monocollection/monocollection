The rose is the epitome of the beautiful flower, and is referred to as the queen of flowers all over the world. It is a symbol of love, as well as of death. My rose pattern was created instantly out of the inspiration I got from seeing a rose bush reflected on a paper sliding door one evening when there was a bright moon.

A natural object has been converted into a shadow, and expressed in a two-tone print in order to render the mysteriousness and sentiment of the shadow rather romantically. It was printed on a Korean paper, and placed along the wall during my Peach Blossom Dream exhibition, and was wonderful.

&#x2A; Rose
