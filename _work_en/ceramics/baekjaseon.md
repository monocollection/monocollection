There are various kinds of white porcelains in Joseon; Ipho is tall, with beautiful curvature of body, Wonho is spherical, and Daeho is large. Wonho and Daeho are sometimes collectively called Dalhangari. Ipho-they are vertical and tall with a body that is wide at the shoulders and narrows toward the bottom. Dalhangari is spherical like a moon.

I wanted to express these kaleidoscopic figures, drawn with indeterminate circles on white porcelain, in a new formal language of simplified lines. I extracted the contour lines of Ipho and created patterns for wallpaper. As I used only the lines of the white porcelain, I named them Baekjaseon.
