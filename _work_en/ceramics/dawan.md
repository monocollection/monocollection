The Dawan, also called Chatsabal or Maksabal, was first made in China and then spread to Japan through Goryeo and Joseon. I love the celadon green of Goryeo celadon, so I collected a few Goryeo celadon in light, dark, clear but obscure green shades.
When I was looking for celadon green for a tea bowl, I saw a cool watercolor painting with concentric circles spreading around a pond while standing and looking down on the tea bowls lying on the floor. I transcribed this shade of color on the celadon tea bowl into the pattern with faded paint. I also used it for wallpaper for a hotel lobby, and bedding.
