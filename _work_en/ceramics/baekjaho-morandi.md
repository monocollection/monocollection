I worked mostly  on the line of white porcelain or their insides, and was inspired by the paintings of the modern Italian  artist Giorgio Morandi. I tried to give a feeling of the rich bloom of the three-dimensional porcelain. In addition, I  worked  rhymically by repeating the white porcelain jar and the moon jar with an animated drawing technique similar to that  seen in ancient Korean wall paintings.
