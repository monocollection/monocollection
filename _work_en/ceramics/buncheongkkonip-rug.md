The flower pattern on the  ceramics is drawn at a high speed and freely.  This pattern is designed to be used for carpet rugs and scarves, giving the minimal and fluid feeling that can be seen in the paintings of Henri Matisse,  who simplified to the essence, so that it seems to have been inserted  directly into the drawn figure.
