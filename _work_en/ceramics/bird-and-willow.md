The inlaid celadon of Goryeo is part of the most celebrated heritage of Korean cultural history, not only because of the color of the celadon but also for the engraved patterns. Cheonja Sanggam Suryujomun Daejeop (inlaid celadon bowl with water willow and bird pattern) is a masterpiece in which the bird and willow are painted on a bowl 16cm wide.

I made a pattern by applying the beauty and the depth of color in this celadon. I took the round patterns from the bowl and floated them like soap bubbles sporadically by omitting or keeping the willow intact in some of them, and took out a few cranes and let them fly in the sky made of the patterns. This pattern was received very well as wallpaper, curtains, and armchair covers.
